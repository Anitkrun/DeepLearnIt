Running demo of solutions:

openpose:

the original docker file's tf-openpose is installed in a virtual environment(tfpose), so activate it first

- image: ./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir examples/<path_to_images> ; to be executed in the root of 'openpose'
- video: ./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/<path_to_video> ; to be executed in the root of 'openpose'

tf-openpose:

image: python3 run.py --model=<model name(mobilenet_thin)> --resize=432x368 --image=path/to/image
video: python3 run_video.py --model=<model name> --video path/to/video

both to be run from tf-openpose/src

Lifting from the deep:  Only works on images

image: from /application run demo.py
to change the test image, edit demo.py and edit the following line: (line 21)

///////////
IMAGE_FILE_PATH = PROJECT_PATH + '/data/images/valid_person1.jpg'
