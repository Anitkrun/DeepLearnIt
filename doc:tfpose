*/
  Openpose implemented via tensorflow, contains instructions to put up a tensorflow implemetation of openpose library. 
  For specifications refer to openpose_doc.
  */


Requirements:
  - python3
  - tensorflow 1.4.1+
  - opencv, python3-tk, protobuf
  

Installation:
$ git clone https://www.github.com/ildoonet/tf-openpose
$ cd tf-openpose
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Note: To detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image, a nonparametric representation referred to as Part Affinity Fields 
     (PAFs) is used. Post-processing for Part-Affinity Fields Map is implemented in C++ & Swig and is needed for PAF generation 
     during detection.
     i.e.
     - install swig
     - $swig -python -c++ pafprocess.i && python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

     
Running an example:

Execute from ./tf-openpose/src/ 

$ python3 run.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 --image=<path_to_image>/<name_of_image>
substitute --model=<model_of _your_choice>
